# AI-Driven SOC Alert Prioritization & Response Framework

A machine learning–driven SOC automation framework designed to classify security alerts, prioritize threats based on severity, and recommend remediation actions. The system simulates real-world SOC workflows and demonstrates measurable analyst workload reduction through intelligent alert triage.

---

## Problem Statement

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts face alert fatigue due to high volumes of security events generated by SIEM platforms. Manual triage is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can automate alert prioritization and simulate SOAR-style response recommendations, reducing analyst workload while maintaining detection effectiveness.

---

## Solution Overview

A Random Forest classification model trained on simulated SOC alert data that automatically:

- Classifies alerts into **Critical / High / Medium / Low** severity levels  
- Suggests appropriate remediation actions per severity level  
- Measures operational workload reduction impact  

The framework simulates how ML-assisted triage can support real-world SOC environments.

---

## Architecture Workflow

The system follows a structured SOC automation pipeline:

Alert Data → Feature Extraction → ML Classification → Severity Prediction → Remediation Suggestion → Analyst Review Optimization

### System Flow

1. Simulated SOC alerts generated  
2. Feature engineering applied  
3. Random Forest model classifies severity  
4. Remediation engine maps severity to response playbooks  
5. Workload reduction impact calculated  

---

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Model Accuracy | 97.5% |
| Analyst Workload Reduction | 42.5% |
| Total Alerts Processed | 1000 |
| Auto-handled Alerts | 425 |
| Alerts Requiring Analyst | 575 |

The model demonstrates strong predictive consistency across severity classes, validating the feasibility of ML-assisted alert triage in SOC environments.

## Operational Impact Simulation

### Before Automation
- 1000 alerts manually reviewed  
- Estimated triage time: 3 minutes per alert  
- Total analyst time: 3000 minutes (50 hours)

### After Automation
- 425 low-severity alerts auto-handled  
- 575 alerts require analyst review  
- Estimated analyst time: 1725 minutes (28.75 hours)

### Impact
- Time saved: 1275 minutes (~21.25 hours)  
- Analyst workload reduced by 42.5%

This demonstrates measurable operational efficiency improvement in high-volume SOC environments.

## Model Evaluation Details

The Random Forest model was evaluated using:

- 80/20 Train-Test Split  
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Feature Importance Analysis  

Feature importance analysis revealed that:

- Malware detection flag  
- DNS beaconing behavior  
- External IP activity  

were the strongest predictors of high-severity alerts.

Class imbalance considerations were evaluated to ensure model robustness across severity categories.

## Features Used

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| failed_logins | Number of failed login attempts |
| external_ip | Traffic from external IP (0/1) |
| data_transfer_mb | Volume of data transferred |
| malware_flag | Malware signature detected (0/1) |
| dns_beaconing | DNS beaconing detected (0/1) |

## Automated Remediation & SOAR Simulation

The remediation engine simulates SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) functionality by mapping predicted severity levels to predefined response playbooks.

- **Critical** – Isolate host, block IP, reset credentials, escalate immediately  
- **High** – Investigate IP, reset credentials, review authentication logs  
- **Medium** – Monitor closely, review user activity  
- **Low** – Log and review during scheduled audit  

This demonstrates how ML classification can integrate with automated response workflows.
